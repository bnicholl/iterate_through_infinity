# iterate_through_infinity
Iterate through a list of nodes where each dimension could theoretically be infinity. Here we take a look at utilizing recursive algorithms using DFS, and iterative algorithms using BFS. Take a look at the screen shot above, or click this link:

Trees =  [1, 
[2, None, [4, None, None]], 
[3, [5, [7, None, None], [8, None, None]], 
[6, [9, None, None], [10,[11, None, None], None]]]]
